// A: What will the following two lines of code output?

console.log(0.3 + 0.6);
console.log(0.3 + 0.6 === 0.9);

// Q: The first line computes the sum of two floating numbers and
//    prints the sum out.
//    The second line computes the sum, then it compares both numbers
//    and, then, it prints `true` out.
//    WARN: the second statement prints `false` because of the nature
//          of the floating arithmetic in JS
